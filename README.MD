Professional career.- 
---
I'm a science guy. However I have not been working in Data Science from the beginning. I took my first steps in science in the field of Life Sciences...
* I graduated :mortar_board: from Biotechnology and Molecular Biology in 2012.
* I have a PhD in Exact Sciences (2018).
* I have experience doing science in the United States:\
        :point_right: 2016 Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth\
        :point_right: 2021 Louisiana State University Health.\
\
Here you can find some peer-reviewed articles that I have published in the last few years....[here](https://github.com/nicoambrosis/Peer-review-publications).\
And here you can find a complete list, with more details... [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Nicolas+Ambrosis%5BAuthor%5D&sort=date).
   
           
:computer: . In 2019 I started studying Python programming to apply Data Science tools to my postdoc project. :heart: Immediatly I fell in love with programming, Python and Data Science in general :heart:. So I started taking courses and studying a lot by my own. Nowadays I am taking an anual course of :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: [DATA SCIENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS APPLICATIONS](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) at Universidad Nacional de Córdoba.


Future perspectives.-
---
During the last 13 years I've built a strong background in science. This gave my the ability to think about problems and solutions in a scientific way. **I strongly believe that evidence-based decision making is our best approach to face challenges in life and business.** For the last few months I've been trying to redirect my career towards the Data Science industry. I would like to broaden my horizons so I'm looking for challenges even outside the field of biological sciences.

Soft Skills.-
---
I'm a passionate reader:books: , photographer :camera: and amateur athlete.

I have a modest Canon PC1560 7.4v with an amazing 35X optical zoom. It's not woooow but It allows me to take nice landscapes and B&W [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/nico.ambrosis/). 
I used to love playing football (soccer :soccer:) since I was 4 years old. I was part part of several amateurs teams and competed in football championships every year during my child and teenage years.\
In 2017 I started practicing trail running :running: and fell in love with this sport immediately. Since then, I have ran plenty of races through the amazing landscapes of argentine Patagonia :snowflake: :deciduous_tree:.  
Occasionally I also go to play golf :golf: with my father.
