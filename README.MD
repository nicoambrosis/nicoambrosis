Professional career.- 
---
My name is Nicolas... this is a brief statment of my career...

* I graduated :mortar_board: from Biotechnology and Molecular Biology in 2012.
* I've been working in Molecular Biology and Immunology ever since.
* I have a PhD in Molecular Biology (2018).
* I have experience working in the United States:\
     :point_right: 2016 Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth\
     :point_right: 2021 Louisiana State University
     
I have been working with data since 2012 when started the grad program at National University of La Plata, Argentine. During this time I learned how to perform experiments based on a certain hypothesis, how to graph the results and analyze the data to confirm or reject the original hypothesis. Here you can find some peer-reviewed articles I have published over the last few years....[here](https://github.com/nicoambrosis/Peer-review-publications).          


:computer: . In 2019 I started studying Python programming to apply Data Science tools to my postdoc project. Immediatly I fell in love with programming, Python and Data Science. Nowadays I am taking an anual course of :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: [DATA SCIENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS APPLICATIONS](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba.

For the last few of months I have been trying to redirect my career towards the Data Science industry; I'm looking for positions in the industry in Argentina or abroad.

I'm a passionate reader:books: , photographer :camera: and amateur athlete.

I have a modest Canon PC1560 7.4v whit a amazing 35X optical zoom. It's not woooow but It allows me to take nice landscapes and B&W [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/nico.ambrosis/). 
I used to love playing football (soccer :soccer:) since I was 4 years old. I was part part of several amateurs teams and compete in football championships every year during my child and teenage years.\
In 2017 I started practicing trail running :running: and fell in love with this sport immediately. Since then, I have ran plenty of races through the amazing landscapes of argentine Patagonia :snowflake: :deciduous_tree:.  
Occasionally I also go to play golf :golf: with my father!!
