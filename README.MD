:computer: In 2019 I started studying Python programming to apply Data Science tools to my postdoc project. Immediatly I fell in love with programming, Python and Data Science. Now a days I am taking an anual course of [DATA SCIENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS APPLICATIONS](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba.

For the last couple of months I have been trying to redirect my career towards the Data Science industry; so I'm looking for positions in the industry in Argentina or abroad.

I'm a passionate photographer and amateur athlete.

I have a modest Canon PC1560 7.4v whit a amazing 35X optical zoom. It's not woooow but It allows me to take nice landscapes and B&W pictures. 
I used to love playing football (soccer) since I was 4 years old. I was part part of several amateurs teams and compete in football championships every year during my childhood and adolescence.
In 2017 I started practicing trail running and fell in love with this sport immediately. Since then, I have ran plenty of races throw amazing landscape of argentine Patagonia.
