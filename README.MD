I have been working with data since 2012 when started the grad program at National University of La Plata, Argentine. During this time I learned how to perform experiments based on a certain hypothesis, how to graph the results and analyze the data to confirm or reject the original hypothesis. Here you can find some peer-reviewed articles I have published over the last few years....[here](https://github.com/nicoambrosis/Peer-review-publications).          


:computer: . In 2019 I started studying Python programming to apply Data Science tools to my postdoc project. Immediatly I fell in love with programming, Python and Data Science. Nowadays I am taking an anual course of :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: [DATA SCIENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS APPLICATIONS](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba.

For the last few of months I have been trying to redirect my career towards the Data Science industry; I'm looking for positions in the industry in Argentina or abroad.
