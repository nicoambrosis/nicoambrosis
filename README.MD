:computer: In 2019 I started studying Python programming to apply Data Science tools to my postdoc project. Immediatly I fell in love with programming, Python and Data Science. Now a days I am taking an anual course of :bar_chart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: [DATA SCIENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND ITS APPLICATIONS](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba.
